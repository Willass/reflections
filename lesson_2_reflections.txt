What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?:
A new git repository is created. It will then be unseen and the metadata of files will accrue in it which will be useful for file comparing in the future.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?:
The staging area holds files that are related together to be later classified as a single commit - all to achieve a logical, concise commits.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?:
The staging area is a middle ground between the Working directory and the Repository. Before commiting, multiple files can be added to the staging area if they are deemed interrelated becoming a bundle as one commit message. It also allows comparison between an edited file in the working directory to be comapared to the latest commit with the command git diff --staged to double check if the files in the staging area are really what i want to commit.
